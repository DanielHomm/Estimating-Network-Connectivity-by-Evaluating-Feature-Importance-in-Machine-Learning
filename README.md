# Estimating-Network-Connectivity-by-Evaluating-Feature-Importance-in-Machine-Learning

This repository contains the final jupyter notebook for the investigation, estimating network connectivity by evaluating feature importance in machine learning.
In this research, I investigated the usage of the SHAP approximation method, SHAP DeepExplainer, to reconstruct connectivities given in the training data of a LSTM Model by evaluating
the feature importance in the model.
