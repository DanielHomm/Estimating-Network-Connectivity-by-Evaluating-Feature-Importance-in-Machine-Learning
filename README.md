# Estimating-Network-Connectivity-by-Evaluating-Feature-Importance-in-Machine-Learning

This repository contains the final jupyter notebook for the reconstruction of network connectivity by evaluating the importance of features in machine learning.

In this research, I use the SHAP approximation method, SHAP DeepExplainer, for a first approach to reconstruct connectivities in synthetic time-series data. In theory, the connections in the data should be represented by
the feature importance of a trained model (in our case LSTM).

All further explanations can be found in the notebook.
